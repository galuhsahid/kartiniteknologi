      <description>Indonesia needs more women in the technology industry. Technology has come to dominate people&amp;rsquo;s lives. When the creators of technology is dominated by certain groups, there will be bias which will cause disparity in the resulting products.
We believe in the virtues of diversity. Through Kartini Teknologi, we want to encourage more Indonesian women to get involved in the technology industry. The objective is to reduce or even close the tech industry&amp;rsquo;s gender gap.</description>

      <description>Hi! Before we get started, we&amp;rsquo;d like to say thank you for being with us here at Kartini Teknologi. In this page, you can find a few things that might be helpful for you before our conversation. ðŸ™Œ
We can do our conversation in two ways: face-to-face &amp;amp; remote conversation. These notes are primarily aimed at guests who we&amp;rsquo;ll be having remote conversations with.
What You&amp;rsquo;ll Need Being able to hear each other clearly is essential in the making of a good conversation.</description>
