Hi! Before we get started, we'd like to say thank you for being with us here at Kartini Teknologi. In this page, you can find a few things that might be helpful for you before our conversation. 🙌

We can do our conversation in two ways: face-to-face & remote conversation. These notes are primarily aimed at guests who we'll be having remote conversations with.

## What You'll Need
Being able to hear each other clearly is essential in the making of a good conversation. Here are some things that you'll need:

- A good Internet connection
- A quiet environment (ideally there's no background sound and you can have some privacy)

If there are issues with one or both of the things above, we may need to reschedule the show.

## Zoom 📹
We'll use Zoom to record our show. Zoom has a free client that you can download [here](https://zoom.us/download). Make sure that you go to Zoom Preferences and turn off the checkbox that says "Always mute microphone when joining meeting".

Shortly before the show, we'll send you a Zoom link that will take you to our conversation room.

## Microphone 🎙️
If you can wear headphones and talk into a microphone, that's awesome! If you can't, you can use the built-in mic on laptops but keep in mind that the sound quality will be lower.

## Internet Connection 💻
1. If you have an ethernet cable, you can use it to reduce latency
2. Restart computer and Zoom before we start
3. Pause syncing services (e.g. Dropbox) and quit other Internet-using apps
