## Hey all!

Counting days to the Kartini's day, when we will launch our Podcast, Kartini Teknologi, we want to introduce ourselves as the hosts. Also to tell you about why we create this podcast in the first place. Plus, to give you a sneak peek about our very first guest next week.

Nice to meet you and see you all in the next episode!
