### Indonesia needs more women in the technology industry.

Technology has come to dominate people's lives. When the creators of technology is dominated by certain groups, there will be bias which will cause disparity in the resulting products.

We believe in the virtues of diversity. Through Kartini Teknologi, we want to encourage more Indonesian women to get involved in the technology industry. The objective is to reduce or even close the tech industry's gender gap.

In each episode, we will talk with an inspirational Indonesian woman who currently works in tech about a field that they are expert at. We'll also talk about their journey to get where they are now.
